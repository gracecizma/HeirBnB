## Description

Welcome to HeirBnB, a vaction rental exclusively for heirs and heriesses to exchange vacation homes while travelling. Our site allows registered users to search for the perfect home that suits their needs - whether that be over 10 bedrooms, a tennis court and a pool, or a country club within walking distance. Users can also list their own properties to rent, fairly priced of course.
